# Pong-game
A simple Pong game implemented in Python.

# Pong Game (Python)

A simple implementation of the classic **Pong** arcade game built with **Python**.  
This project demonstrates fundamental game development concepts such as movement, collision detection, and score tracking.

## Features
- Two-player paddle control
- Ball movement with wall and paddle collision
- Score tracking system
- Simple and clean gameplay logic

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Turtle graphics *(if Pygame ishlatgan bo‘lsang, Turtle’ni Pygame bilan almashtir)*

## Project Structure

main.py # Main game loop
ball.py # Ball movement and collision logic
paddle.py # Paddle control
scoreboard.py # Score handling


## How to Run
1. Make sure **Python 3** is installed
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pong-game-python.git


Run the game:

python main.py


Controls

Left Paddle: W / S

Right Paddle: Up Arrow / Down Arrow
